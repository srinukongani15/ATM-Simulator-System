ATM Simulator System



Project Overview
This is an ATM Simulator System project designed to simulate the functionalities of an ATM, including:

Frontend: Developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the user interface.


Backend: Implemented in Java, with database connectivity to simulate transactions and account management.

Frontend:

JavaScript

Backend:



Java (Spring Boot or Servlet-based)


Database:

MySQL / PostgreSQL / SQLite (depending on your choice)
Features



Login Authentication: Users can log in with a username and pin.

Balance Enquiry: View account balance.

Deposit Funds: Option to deposit money into the account.

Withdraw Funds: Option to withdraw money from the account.

Transaction History: View transaction details (withdrawal and deposit logs).


Frontend
The frontend is developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It provides a simple, interactive interface for users to interact with the ATM system.

Login Page: Allows users to input their account details (username and pin).

ATM Dashboard: Displays the options to check balance, deposit money, withdraw money, etc.


Backend
The backend is built using Java with a choice of frameworks (Spring Boot / Servlets). It handles the business logic of the ATM system, such as validating login details, performing transactions, and interacting with the database.



API Endpoints:

POST /login: Validate user credentials.

GET /balance: Retrieve the account balance.

POST /withdraw: Process withdrawal requests.

POST /deposit: Process deposit requests.

GET /transaction-history: Fetch transaction logs.



Database Connectivity
The database is used to store user account information, including:

User Table: Stores username, pin, and balance.


Transaction Table: Logs all transactions (deposits/withdrawals) performed by the user.


We have used MySQL (or any other database you choose) for this project.


Example SQL queries:


sql



CREATE TABLE Users (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    username VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    pin VARCHAR(10) NOT NULL,
    balance DECIMAL(10, 2) DEFAULT 0
);




CREATE TABLE Transactions (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id INT,
    type ENUM('deposit', 'withdraw') NOT NULL,
    amount DECIMAL(10, 2),
    date TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    FOREIGN KEY(user_id) REFERENCES Users(id)
);



How to Run the Project

Prerequisites

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (can be opened in any modern web browser)

Backend: Java (JDK 11 or above), Maven (for dependencies and building)

Database: MySQL (or your preferred database)


Steps to Run:


Clone the repository:


bash


git clone https://github.com/your-username/ATM-Simulator-System.git

cd ATM-Simulator-System

Set up the database:


Create a MySQL database and import the SQL scripts for user and transaction tables.

Modify the database connection details in the application.properties (or equivalent config file in your backend).
Backend Setup (Java):


If using Maven, build the Java backend:

bash


mvn clean install

Run the backend server:
bash

mvn spring-boot:run
Or, if using a servlet, deploy it to your servlet container (Tomcat).
Frontend Setup (HTML/CSS/JS):



Open the index.html file in any web browser.


The frontend will connect to the backend server for all transactions.
